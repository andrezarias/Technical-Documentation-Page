            <p>Python is a computer programming language often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis. Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isn’t specialized for any specific problems. </p>
      
            <p>This versatility, along with its beginner-friendliness, has made it one of the most-used programming languages today. A survey conducted by industry analyst firm RedMonk found that it was the second-most popular programming language among developers in 2021 </p>

          <article>
                <p>Python is commonly used for developing websites and software, task automation, data analysis, and data visualization. Since it’s relatively easy to learn, Python has been adopted by many non-programmers such as accountants and scientists, for a variety of everyday tasks, like organizing finances. </p>

                <p>“Writing programs is a very creative and rewarding activity,” says University of Michigan and Coursera instructor Charles R Severance in his book Python for Everybody. “You can write programs for many reasons, ranging from making your living to solving a difficult data analysis problem to having fun to helping someone else solve a problem.”</p>
      
            <ul>
              <p>What can you do with python? Some things include:</p>
              <li>Data analysis and machine learning</li>
              <li>Web development</li>
              <li>Automation or scripting</li>

            <p>Python has become a staple in data science, allowing data analysts and other professionals to use the language to conduct complex statistical calculations, create data visualizations, build machine learning algorithms, manipulate and analyze data, and complete other data-related tasks.</p>
      
            <p>Python can build a wide range of different data visualizations, like line and bar graphs, pie charts, histograms, and 3D plots. Python also has a number of libraries that enable coders to write programs for data analysis and machine learning more quickly and efficiently, like TensorFlow and Keras.</p>

          <header>Web development</header>
        <p>Python is often used to develop the back end of a website or application—the parts that a user doesn’t see. Python’s role in web development can include sending data to and from servers, processing data and communicating with databases, URL routing, and ensuring security. Python offers several frameworks for web development. Commonly used ones include Django and Flask.</p>
            <code
            # Python 3: Fibonacci series up to n
            >>> def fib(n):
            >>>     a, b = 0, 1
            >>>     while a < n:
            >>>         print(a, end=' ')
            >>>         a, b = b, a+b
            >>>     print()
            >>> fib(1000)

         <p> Some web development jobs that use Python include back end engineers, full stack engineers, Python developers, software engineers, and DevOps engineers.</p>

          <header>Automation or scripting</header>
          <p>If you find yourself performing a task over and over again, you could work more efficiently by automating it with Python. Writing code used to build these automated processes is called scripting. In the coding world, automation can be used to check for errors across multiple files, convert files, execute simple math, and remove duplicates in data. </p>
          <p> Python can even be used by relative beginners to automate simple tasks on the computer—such as renaming files, finding and downloading online content or sending emails or texts at desired intervals. </p>

            <p>Python isn't only for programmers and data scientists. Learning Python can open new possibilities for those in less data-heavy professions, like journalists, small business owners, or social media marketers. Python can also enable non-programmer to simplify certain tasks in their lives. Here are just a few of the tasks you could automate with Python: </p>

            <p>Python is popular for a number of reasons. Here’s a deeper look at what makes it so versatile and easy to use for coders.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It has a simple syntax that mimics natural language, so it’s easier to read and understand. This makes it quicker to build projects, and faster to improve on them. </li>

                <li>It’s versatile. Python can be used for many different tasks, from web development to machine learning.</li>

                <li>It’s beginner friendly, making it popular for entry-level coders.</li>

                <li>Python has a large and active community that contributes to The vast support community means that if coders run into a stumbling block, finding a solution  is relatively easy; somebody is bound to have run into the same problem before.</li>

                <li>It’s open source, which means it’s free to use and distribute, even for commercial purposes.</li>

                <li>Python’s pool of modules and libraries, and acts as a helpful resource for other programmers. </li>

          <article>
            <p> Python projects come in all sorts of shapes, sizes, and purposes. The way you document your project should suit your specific situation. Keep in mind who the users of your project are going to be and adapt to their needs. Depending on the project type, certain aspects of documentation are recommended. The general layout of the project and its documentation should be as follows:</p>
            <code>project_root/
                │
                ├── project/  # Project source code

          <article>
            <p>Public and Open Source projects are projects that are intended to be shared with a large group of users and can involve large development teams. These projects should place as high of a priority on project documentation as the actual development of the project itself. Some of the recommended parts to add to the project are the following:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Readme: A brief summary of the project and its purpose. Include any special requirements for installing or operating the projects. Additionally, add any major changes since the previous version. Finally, add links to further documentation, bug reporting, and any other important information for the project. Dan Bader has put together a great tutorial on what all should be included in your readme.</li>

               <li>How to Contribute: This should include how new contributors to the project can help. This includes developing new features, fixing known issues, adding documentation, adding new tests, or reporting issues.</li>

               <li>Code of Conduct: Defines how other contributors should treat each other when developing or using your software. This also states what will happen if this code is broken. If you’re using Github, a Code of Conduct template can be generated with recommended wording. For Open Source projects especially, consider adding this.</li>

               <li>License: A plaintext file that describes the license your project is using. For Open Source projects especially, consider adding this.</li>
              
               <li>docs: A folder that contains further documentation. The next section describes more fully what should be included and how to organize the contents of this folder</li>
                
            </ul>
            <p> Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you
              to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions
              are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of
              objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that
              your application can perform.</p>

            <p>The documentation of projects have a simple progression:</p>
             <ol>
                 <li>No Documentation</li>
                 <li>Some Documentation</li>
                 <li>Complete Documentation</li>
                 <li> Good Documentation</li>
                 <li>Great Documentation</li>
             </ol>
             <p>If you’re at a loss about where to go next with your documentation, look at where your project is now in relation to the progression above. Do you have any documentation? If not, then start there. If you have some documentation but are missing some of the key project files, get started by adding those.</p>
